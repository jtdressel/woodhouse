# Woodhouse #
Woodhouse is a collection of python scripts to do some housekeeping for *nix 
systems. The basic premise is to keep config files in a Dropbox folder, and 
create symlinks in your new system for config files that will update across all of your systems.  

Currently Woodhouse is unstable.
